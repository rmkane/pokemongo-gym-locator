# Pok√©mon GO &mdash; Gym Locator

The main page presents the user with a search bar. A user can enter a Gym name, text to be searched for with the notes, and the area the Gym is located in.

Each search result can be clicked on to display a simple popup of the Gym; including name, address, image, coordinates, and notes. The window can be popped-out to produce a separate page which can be shared with other users.

The individual gym pages contain a list of nearby gyms with the closest ones at the top. Each nearby gym will display the distance from the current gym, along with the direction.
